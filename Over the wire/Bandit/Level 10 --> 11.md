i started the challenge by reading in OverTheWire.
then i went to the terminal and connected to it.
by putting ` ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
and password as `FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey`
then i typed `base64 -d data.txt`.
this uses base64 decoder for the dat.txt.
then i noted the password `dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr`.
after that i typed exit to get of the shell.
