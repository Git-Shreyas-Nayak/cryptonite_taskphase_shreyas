# Level 11 --> 12

## Procedure
i started the challenge by reading in OverTheWire.
then i went to the terminal and connected to it.
by putting ` ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
and password as `dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr`
then i typed `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt`.
this changes the values y +13 and gives the decoded output.
then i noted the password `7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`.
after that i typed exit to get of the shell.

## bash
```
bandit11@bandit:~$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`
```
