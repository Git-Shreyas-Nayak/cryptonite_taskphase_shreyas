# bandit 8 --> 9

## Procedure
i started the challenge by reading in OverTheWire.
then i went to the terminal and connected to it.
by putting ssh bandit @bandit8.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
and password as `dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc`.
then i typed `sort data.txt | uniq -u`.
this sorts data.txt to all  the lines which are unique.
then i noted the password `4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM`.
after that i typed exit to get of the shell.


## bash
`bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
