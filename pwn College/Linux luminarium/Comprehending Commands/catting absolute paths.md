# catting absolute paths

## Procedure
first i started the challenge from `pwn.college` and went to the terminal.
cat basically is displaying so we needed to type ` cat flag`.
but it was not there hence `cd /` was used.
now use` cat flag`.
then i pasted the flag in the site.

## Code
`hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cd /
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:/$ cat flag
pwn.college{EXgHsbTPDJdivhyBw7XHADQcrcv.dlTM5QDL5EjN0czW}`
