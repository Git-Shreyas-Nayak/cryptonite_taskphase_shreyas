# Your first shell

## Procedure
i started the challenge pwn.college
as per the question.
then i typed `touch x.sh` to created a shell script.
then i used echo /challenge/pwn >> x.sh 
and then typed echo /challenge/college >> x.sh to append those both.
after that i used bash x.sh to get the flag.
then i pasted my flag to the website.

## Code
`hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch hey.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/pwn >> hey.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/college >> hey.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash hey.sh
