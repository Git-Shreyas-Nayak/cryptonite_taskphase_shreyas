# Storing Command Output

## Procedure
i started the challenge `pwn.college`
as per the question.
then i typed `PWN=$(/challenge/run)`
so here the pwn stores te flag that is runned in /challenge/run
so to see whats inside the variable i typed `echo "$PWN"`
then i pasted my flag to the website.

## Code
`hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ PWN=$(/challenge/run)
Congratulations! You have read the flag into the PWN variable. Now print it out
and submit it!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ echo "$PWN"
pwn.college{492_PCfo0YS7cy-_CTVYVl1PJ0O.dVzN0UDL5EjN0czW}`
