# Reading files

## Procedure
i started the challenge pwn.college
as per the question.
then i typed `read PWN < /challenge/read_me`
so pwn stores the value of whatever the /challenge/read_me has runned.
then i pasted my flag to the website.

## Code
`hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{AaxBWwhxuJJ19nststG-OW8VFX2.dBjM4QDL5EjN0czW}`

## References
Nothing
