# more catting practice

## Procedure
first i started the challenge from `pwn.college` and went to the terminal.
cat basically is displaying so we needed to type and it is stored somewhere else.
hence we need to type `cat /usr/share/gst-plugins-base/flag`.
then i pasted the flag in the site.

## Code
`hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/gst-plugins-base/flag
pwn.college{Q1TNOzZY4TqC5GKDPsoqrEG_bsc.dBjM5QDL5EjN0czW}`

## Reference
Nothing
