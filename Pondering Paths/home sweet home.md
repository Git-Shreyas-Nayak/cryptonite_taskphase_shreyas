# home sweet home

## procedure
first i started the code challenge in pwn.college.
then as per the question i wrote `./challenge/run`.
but i needed to provide that with an argument hence i read the question again and again .
then i got to know what `cd /` and `cd ~` does .
this goes complete left and right.
so how much char u give after`/ that many times it proceedes.hence as i want to be in home i typed `/challenge/run ~/a`
after that i pasted the flag in the pwn.collage.

## code
`hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run
You must provide an argument to /challenge/run when you invoke it!
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{4KKw6z6SSKkK9Te13iXIGTsSxBw.dNzM4QDL5EjN0czW}`
